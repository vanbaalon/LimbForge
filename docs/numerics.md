# Numerical representation and recurrences

## Numeric contract

Every nonzero value has a normalized unsigned `bits`-bit significand, sign ±1,
and a separate binary exponent:

```
value = sign * integer(limb) * 2^(exponent - (bits - 1))
```

Limbs are little-endian 32-bit words. Valid exponents range from -1,000,000,000
to +1,000,000,000. Real operations use round-to-nearest, ties-to-even. Zero is
canonical, with all fields zero. There are no NaNs, infinities, signed zeros,
or subnormal encodings. Invalid conversion, division by zero, and exponent
overflow produce a zero payload with explicit status bits; further real
operations propagate those bits. Host dispatch failures throw exceptions.

| Status | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `ok` | 0 | Valid result |
| `division_by_zero` | 1 | Zero divisor |
| `exponent_overflow` | 2 | Result outside the supported exponent range |
| `invalid` | 4 | Conversion of a non-finite MPFR value |

Statuses are a bitmask. Each real component has its own status; check both
components of complex results. `to_mpfr` throws for an error status. For a
nonzero raw input, set the high bit of the top limb, sign to ±1, and the exponent
within the documented range. Raw payloads that violate this contract are not
validated inside every arithmetic kernel.

Complex multiplication/division compose the rounded real operations in
`core.hpp`, with a separately rounded result after each real primitive. They do **not**
promise a single correctly rounded MPC complex operation. The recurrence kernel
preserves the documented sequential accumulation order; it does not fuse away
real rounding steps. Construct raw values only according to this contract.

The same core header works on the CPU and inside a Metal shader. Include
`mpfr_bridge.hpp` only on the CPU. The raw real struct occupies `bits/8 + 12`
bytes; a complex struct occupies twice that. Input and output buffers must match
the requested precision and operation.

## Recurrences

`Engine::recurrence` computes independent trajectories:

```
next = weights[0]*q0 + weights[1]*q1 + weights[2]*q2 + weights[3]*q3
q0 = q1; q1 = q2; q2 = q3; q3 = next
```

Each trajectory has four complex seeds, ordered oldest to newest in propagation
order. Seeds are arranged as `seeds[j*count+i]`. With `states_per_weight=1`,
weights are `weights[(step*4+j)*count+i]`. When adjacent trajectories share
coefficients, pass `states_per_weight`; the weight layout becomes
`weights[(step*4+j)*(count/states_per_weight)+i/states_per_weight]`. The output is
the final `q3`; zero steps return the fourth seed.
